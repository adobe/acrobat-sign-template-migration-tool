# sign-doc-reuploader

## Dependencies

You need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

## Install and run

1. [Download](https://github.com/rossgk2/sign-doc-reuploader/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the zip of this repo and extract it.
2. Rename the extracted folder to something (e.g. `fldr`).
3. In a command prompt `cd` to `fldr` and then `npm install`.
4. To run the script, execute `npx ts-node reuploader.ts` (not `node reuploader.ts`, since we're using TypeScript).
